# Quizora

This repository is a backend for Quizora, a Python-based desktop quiz game. This backend service is built using Django Web and a framework for Python. It has two components (apps): Dashboard and RESTful API. 
**[Dashboard](#dashboard)**: Interactive platform for students, teachers and administrators. It helps to visualise students' progress in the Game and what units students need to focus on.
**[RestFul API](#restful-api)**: Serves as a communication service between the Game and the Database using API endpoints. It is built using Django's Rest Framework for rapid development and deployment.

## Restful API
- **Role-Based Access Control**: 
  - **Admin**: Can manage users, quizzes, and view reports.
  - **Teacher**: Can create and manage quiz questions.
  - **Student**: Can participate in quizzes and view their scores.
  
- **User Management**:
  - Supports different user roles (admin, teacher, and student).
  - Allows for account creation, login, and role-based access.
  
- **Quiz Creation**:
  - Teachers can create quizzes by adding multiple-choice questions with options.
  - Quizzes are stored in a database for easy management and retrieval.

- **Game Sessions**:
  - Students can participate in quizzes and their results are stored in game sessions.
  - Scores are calculated based on correct answers and displayed at the end of the session.

- **Dynamic Question Management**:
  - Teachers can add, edit, and delete questions with flexible options (e.g., multiple-choice).
  
- **Security**:
  - Uses environment variables to protect sensitive data like the Django `SECRET_KEY`.
  - Role-based permissions ensure that only authorized users have access to certain features.


## Dashboard

## Features


## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Django (Python) â€“ a high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design.
- **Database**: SQLite (for development), with the ability to switch to PostgreSQL, MySQL, or other databases for production.
- **Frontend**: Basic Django templates (HTML, CSS) for displaying the quiz interface.
- **Environment Management**: Python-decouple for environment variable management, ensuring security and scalability.
