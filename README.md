# Quizora

This repository contains the backend for Quizora Python based game using Django. The backend is designed to provide a RestFul API (API app) and interactive platform for students, teachers, and administrators. It allows users to create, manage, and participate in quizzes tailored to educational purposes, with a focus on arithmetic quizzes. The app is built with a clean and scalable structure, leveraging Django's robust framework for rapid development and deployment.

## Features

- **Role-Based Access Control**: 
  - **Admin**: Can manage users, quizzes, and view reports.
  - **Teacher**: Can create and manage quiz questions.
  - **Student**: Can participate in quizzes and view their scores.
  
- **User Management**:
  - Supports different user roles (admin, teacher, and student).
  - Allows for account creation, login, and role-based access.
  
- **Quiz Creation**:
  - Teachers can create quizzes by adding multiple-choice questions with options.
  - Quizzes are stored in a database for easy management and retrieval.

- **Game Sessions**:
  - Students can participate in quizzes and their results are stored in game sessions.
  - Scores are calculated based on correct answers and displayed at the end of the session.

- **Dynamic Question Management**:
  - Teachers can add, edit, and delete questions with flexible options (e.g., multiple-choice).
  
- **Security**:
  - Uses environment variables to protect sensitive data like the Django `SECRET_KEY`.
  - Role-based permissions ensure that only authorized users have access to certain features.

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Django (Python) â€“ a high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design.
- **Database**: SQLite (for development), with the ability to switch to PostgreSQL, MySQL, or other databases for production.
- **Frontend**: Basic Django templates (HTML, CSS) for displaying the quiz interface.
- **Environment Management**: Python-decouple for environment variable management, ensuring security and scalability.
